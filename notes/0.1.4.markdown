## CrossPerProjectPlugin

sbt-doge 0.1.4 adds `CrossPerProjectPlugin`, which overrides sbt's `+` and `++` commands and uses doge's implementation that aggregates command respecting `crossScalaVersions` at each subproject.

    lazy val rootProj = (project in file(".")).
      enablePlugins(CrossPerProjectPlugin).
      aggregate(libProj, fooPlugin).
      settings(commonSettings: _*)

With the above setting

    > ;so clean; such test; very publishLocal

can now be written as

    > ;+ clean; + test; + publishLocal

## wow

`wow` command is a substitute of `++` that only affects the aggregated subprojects.
