## Improvements
- Adds ability to cross build individual projects. [#3][3] by [@jroper][@jroper]
- Adds `+++ 2.11.4 compile` command which aggregates only the subproject that contains `2.11.4` in `crossScalaVersions`. [#4][4] by [@jroper][@jroper]
- Runs the aggregated commands in parallel when possible. [#6][6] by [@jroper][@jroper]
